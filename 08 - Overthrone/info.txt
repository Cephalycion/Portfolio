OverThrone is a 2D side-scrolling action-puzzle platformer where the King has gone mad
from paranoia due to the countless wars he has waged, seeing everyone as a potential
enemy and has secluded himself deep within the castle, ordering his guards to execute
those he sees as enemies. The common folk, seeing this tyranny unfold, have ignited a
revolt to dethrone the Mad King. Equipped with the knowledge and skills passed down
from the very first Stonemasons that built the kingdom, pick up and throw rocks and
swing from platform to platform as you lead the charge into the castle to topple the
Mad King's rule and free the people!
